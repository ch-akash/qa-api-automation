RestAssured is a Java library that provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing powerful, maintainable tests for RESTful APIs.
It can validate the response status code, headers, and response body.
It has inbuilt support for BDD (Behavior Driven Development) style of writing tests.
It has inbuilt serialization and deserialization of request and response which is based on Jackson.
It supports JsonPath, XPath, and XmlPath to parse the response.
It supports Hamcrest Matchers to validate the response.
Jsonschema validation is also supported by RestAssured.
It is your one-stop solution for API testing. All the common HTTP methods are supported: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and HEAD.
